### GitHub Actions Configuration Explanation

1. **GitHub Actions Configuration**: This YAML file configures a GitHub Action to automate Java CI with Maven.

2. **Event Triggers**: The action is triggered on two events:
   - Push to the `main` branch.
   - Pull request to the `main` branch.

3. **Jobs Definition**:
   - **Job Name**: `build`.
   - **Operating System**: Ubuntu latest.

4. **Steps**:
   - **Step 1: Checkout Repository**: Utilizes the built-in GitHub Action to checkout the repository.
   - **Step 2: Set up JDK 17**: Configures JDK 17 using the `actions/setup-java` action.
   - **Step 3: Build with Maven**: Executes Maven build using `mvn clean install` command within the specified directory.
   - **Step 4: Login into Docker Hub**: Authenticates Docker login using secrets (`DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD`) stored in the GitHub repository.
   - **Step 5: Build Docker Image**: Builds a Docker image named `vamsibujji/springboot-cicd`.
   - **Step 6: Publish Docker Image**: Pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub.

These notes and YAML configuration can serve as a reference for setting up similar GitHub Actions in the future.
